starts with strong and detailed world-building.  Towards the end rather runs
out of time to resolve the central conflict.  The main character, Paul Maud'Dib
Atreides is a bit of a white saviour but also quite passive for a lot of the
plot.  Almost all the Fremen words are barely-altered Arabic words for the same
thing.

return.  A lot of anxiety about tale-telling and reputation, and the nature of
kingship.  At the end, the main reason he dies is because he insists on solo
combat, and all but one of retinue refuse to get involved in the fight.

Writer gets a stipend to work at an institute on the shores of Lake Wannssee.
Already pretty on the edge by the time he gets there, he starts to fall apart
at the idea of having to work in an open-plan office; the institute has an
overwhelming emphasis on transparency and openness.  Brief interlude where he
learns the life story of a woman who went from punk musician to Stasi
informant.  Gets dragged to a fundraiser (awards ceremony?), where he meets
Anton, who's the man behind the ultra-violent cop show narrator's been
watching.  Anton turns out to be alt-right; narrator gets obsessed with
confronting him to in some metaphysical sense save the world, ends up having a
breakdown on a remote Scottish island.  By the end of the book he's back in
Brooklyn and well enough to watch the 2016 Presidential election go wrong.
