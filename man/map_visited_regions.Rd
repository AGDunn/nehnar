\description{
This function will return a map of a country with
only certain regions visible, based on supplying
it a list of which regions should be shown.
}
\details{
Originally, this function was to show the places we'd visit within a
particular country, at the level of the administrative subdivision.  The
terminology reflects this.  Before running this function, you'll need a
dataframe that has a variable of ISO_3166_A2 codes for regions.  The
function will grab the map data based on the country you ask for but in the 
next version it'll accept an existing sf shape instead.  Can return
`nation'-level of detail for UK but will retain their internal borders and
make a nonsense of things if more than one country is included in the map.
